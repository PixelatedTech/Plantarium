# Plantarium

Plantarium is an interactive educational website about the solar system, created as part of my Interactive Development module at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
I chose a this space theme because space is cool, mysterious, and honestly who wouldn't want to vibe with the stars while learning?

This project was all about making science feel less boring and more hands-on, so I designed the site to be interactive, visual, and fun to explore.
Think of it as a mini digital space adventure.

Features
- Interactive planet exploration [click and learn about each planet]
- Smooth UI/UX design [clean layouts, fluid animations]
- Creative space theme [dark cosmic backgrounds, glowing elements]
- Responsive design 
- Educational content [facts about each planet]

This wasn’t just a coursework assignment to me 
I wanted to create something that felt alive.
I focused a lot on small details like hover animations, planet glow effects, and making the experience feel immersive, like you’re actually traveling across the solar system.

Space has always fascinated me , the vastness, the unknown, the idea that there’s so much more out there.

This project was my small tribute to that curiosity.
